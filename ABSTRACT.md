The authors of **Eschikon Wheat Segmentation** dataset emphasize the importance of robust automated leaf and background segmentation in high-throughput field phenotyping. They present a novel workflow utilizing DeepLab v3+ and a diverse dataset of 190 RGB images featuring winter wheat plants from various genotypes and developmental stages, captured under different outdoor conditions.

The dataset comprises 350 × 350 pixel image patches sourced from a vast unlabeled dataset containing around 100,000 20 Mpx RGB images of diverse winter wheat genotypes, collected between 2017 and 2020 using a Canon 5D Mark II. These images were captured with varying ISO, aperture, and shutter speed settings to adapt to changing illumination conditions. The dataset spans the entire growth cycle of winter wheat, encompassing situations with fluctuating illumination and soil moisture levels.

For the training set, the authors selected images of wheat canopies from emergence to stem elongation, striving for a balanced representation of different imaging scenarios. They prioritized growth stage and limited the selection to recognizable seedlings up to stem elongation, a critical phase for yield component development. The images were further grouped based on illumination conditions (direct and diffuse light), although this grouping simplified the lighting dynamics. Consequently, the dataset includes an overrepresentation of images in the direct light category (approximately 55%). Additionally, the wheat genotypes were divided into random and specific categories, resulting in a partitioned EWS dataset.

The authors processed a subset of 190 RGB images, cropping them into 350 × 350 pixel patches and manually annotating binary masks for plants and soil using GIMP6. The chosen patch size ensured visibility of at least two wheat rows, even after image rotations or cropping. The annotated masks were exported as lossless 8-bit monochromatic PNG images, requiring approximately 80 hours of combined annotation.

The dataset also includes metadata like image timestamps, camera settings, and weather station data. Data acquisition dates focus on spring and late fall, corresponding to the winter wheat growth cycle. Images were captured at various times of the day, with camera settings adjusted for lighting conditions
