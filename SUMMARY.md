**EWS: Eschikon Wheat Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the genetic research. 



The dataset consists of 190 images with 190 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*plant*).

Images in the EWS dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (24 images), *train* (142 images), and *validation* (24 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [ETH Zurich, Switzerland](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and [Agroscope, Switzerland](https://www.agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home.html).
