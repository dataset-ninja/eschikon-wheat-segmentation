**Eschikon Wheat Segmentation** is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, industrial domain, and agricultural research. 

The dataset consists of 190 images with 190 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*Wheat*).

Images in the EWS Dataset dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (24 images), *train* (142 images), and *validation* (24 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
